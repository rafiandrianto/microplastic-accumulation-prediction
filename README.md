# Microplastic Accumulation Prediction
A predictive model was developed to adress the challenges posed by microplastic. This project uses two dif- ferent models, machine learning and deep learning, specifically random forest and Long Short-Term Memory. These models are used to predict the concentration of microplastics, in areas over time. The development of such model can be useful for a number of reasons. Firstly, it enables us to identify areas that are severely impacted by pollution allowing for prompt cleanup operations. Additionally, this model aids in comprehending the relationship between environmental factors and the distribution of microplastics. It provides insights into how these particles move and accumulate in the ocean thus facilitating in mitigation and prevention efforts.
